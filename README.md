Explanation:

Template Literals:
The backticks allow you to embed expressions inside the string using ${}.
This method is more modern and preferred for its readability, especially when dealing with longer strings or multiple variables.

String Concatenation:
This method uses the + operator to join strings and variables.
It works perfectly but can become cumbersome with longer strings or multiple variables.

Both methods are correct and will produce the same output. Template literals are generally preferred in modern JavaScript due to their simplicity and readability.
